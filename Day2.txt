#Day2 Devops
This is about how the developer write a code of a file locally(git) and how it is then been uploaded on a centraized version control system (github). This is known as workstation
and  the above work is done by Developer guys.
After the developer upload or push the code on a CVCS, the operation guys download the code and create the enviroment for client to view the creation. 
for all the above task we require 3 system:
- one local VCS(git) (i downloaded git on windows) 
- one CVCS (github)
- one system for operation guys to create enviroment(in my case it's redhat8)
(Create an account on github, if you don't have any
dowload git for windows (yum install git for liux))
---------------------first----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#create a folder 
mkdir folder_name
#make it a git repo (git status ---show you that the folder is not a repo)
git init
#to create a file 
cat> file_name  
#you ca also use cat>> file_name which will append the content
#after writing press ctrl+d 
# now when the code is done, move it to staging area  where the eye on repo is kept and mind it that no copying of file is performed 
git add file_name
#to check if any version availale 
git log
#Now when you are sure the code is ready you have to commit, which will create a copy of file and store it in storage 
git commit file_name -m first          (it will show error because the git does not know storage loc.)
#these r to be done only once
git config --global user.email "your_email"
git config --gloal user.name ""your_username"
#now you are ready to commit
git commit file_name -m first
#now you can check version and status using 
git log
git status
#Note: now if you commit you don't require to write config 

------------------------------------------second----------------------------------------------------------------------
Now the task is to upload the code from local to centralised VCS(github)
#Create a repo on github
either click on '+' icon on top-right or click on 'new'  on left side
Note:Initialize with README should remain untick because we have code already, we need to upload it and not create a new one
# on git bash
git push                   #fail because no location
#create a origin
git remote add origin URL                  #URL is the http link of your github repository,and origin                                                                  is not mandatory (yoou can use any name) 
#again try to upload
git push                 #fail because no head
#git track keeps an eye on both local and centralised VCS and inform if any changes are made
git push --set-upstream  origin master
#now check git status
git status
# you do not require to remote add origin and setupstream again and again , now only git push will work fine
